		description:
			"In this special edition of ILS 330, a multidisciplinary team of students will develop" +
			" a comprehensive web resource for understanding dis/misinformation designed to destabilize" +
			" social and political processes. We will utilize the 2024 U.S. elections as a resource for" +
			" understanding future elections. This toolkit will provide resources, guidance, tools, and" +
			" datasets related to foreign interference in domestic U.S. democratic processes in addition" +
			" to known bad actors in extremist political movements and domestic conspiracy theories." +
			" We plan to incorporate current resources such as the QAnon archives known as dChan, the" +
			" QAnon crime maps developed at the University of Maryland, the Accelerationist Events Dataset," +
			" Capitol Riot Tweet Dataset, and other publicly available datasets. Additionally, we will" +
			" leverage Purdue’s unique student expertise in STEM to create new resources and data dashboards" +
			" based on these datasets. We will also assemble information literacy tools to help citizens" +
			" understand how to spot and understand mis/disinformation.",
		about:
			"Innovation Capstones are project-based learning environments for university undergraduate and" +
			" graduate students. They are similar to senior design and \"capstone\" projects conducted at" +
			" most universities, however, Innovation Capstones will engage students across all majors –" +
			" business, science, policy, engineering, law, and beyond, to form full multidisciplinary project teams." +
			" These Innovation Capstone teams will work on challenging problems/projects of interest from" +
			" a broad set of stakeholders in the Department of Defense (DoD). Teams will use \"whole of business\"" +
			" and \"whole of government\" approaches to develop their solutions. In some cases, student teams and" +
			" their research topics may be entirely \"business\" or \"policy\" in nature. The intent of Innovation" +
			" Capstones is to broaden the scope of traditional technical developments in areas important to" +
			" national defense, by augmenting teams with students and faculty who can address team organization," +
			" scheduling, financing, and overall business and management skills necessary to introduce new" +
			" products and capabilities into DoD systems. Read more here: https://acqirc.org/innovation-capstone/",
