			"In our current moment, often known colloquially as the \"Information Age,\" the" +
			" veracity of information is of incredible importance, yet we see the viral spread" +
			" and consumption of \"bad\" information: misinformation, disinformation, and" +
			" malinformation. These three forms of information are spread globally regarding" + 
			" every event, from U.S. presidential elections to COVID health protocols, from the" +
			" Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Maui wildfires. Even though more people have access" +
			" to information sources than ever before, we still are living in the age of mis/dis/malinformation." +
			" In this course, a multidisciplinary team of students developed a comprehensive web resource for" +
			" understanding dis/misinformation deigned to destabilize social and political processes." +
			" We also assembled information literacy tools to help citizens understand how to spot and" +
			" understand mis/disinformation. Our work can be accessed below.",
